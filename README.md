## Hackwagon DS102 Project - Building Sustainability Analysis Overview
* Sought to understand the relationship between a commercial building's characteristics and its energy efficiency in Singapore
* Utilized Linear Regression and Decision Tree models to predict the Green Mark Rating<sup>1</sup> of commercial buildings using parameters such as energy usage and property area 
* Plotted geographical locations of these buildings, colored based on their Green Mark Rating, to visualize high and low energy intensity commercial zones
